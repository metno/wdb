		<title>Key Concepts</title>
		
		<para>This section provides an overview of the WCI, including some important
			definitions and explanations.</para>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:wci_overview">
			<title>Overview</title>
			
			<para>WCI is an API designed to retrieve weather data from the WDB system. The WCI
				API resides on the database server.</para>
			
			<para>All function calls on WCI are executed as SQL statements. The SQL
				statements can be executed through a dedicated SQL client application,
				such as psql, pgadmin3, DbVisualizer, or by an application program through
				a database API such as JDBC, ODBC, libpqxx, etc. The WCI is thus not linked
				into the application program itself, but is a component of the
				database.</para>
			
			<para>A data item in WDB could be an observation, a forecast, an analysis, etc.
				Each item consists of a value and a number of dimensions that describe the
				value.</para>
			
			<para>A dimension could be a description of the data item (e.g., temperature),
				its geographic position, its altitude (or depth), the time the data item was
				created, the origin of the data item, etc.</para>
			
			<para>In order to access the data items in WDB, the user should have an understanding of the
				dimensions as they are the entry point into the database. When data is retrieved from
				the database, a set of search criteria is given for each of the
				WCI dimensions. If the search criteria for a dimension is
				not specified (i.e., all NULLs), it is assumed the user wants to retrieve all data items,
				regardless of their dimension description. Please do not attempt this unless the database 
				you are querying is extremely small.</para>
				
			<para>In the context of WCI search criteria, NULL is always interpreted to mean "ALL".</para>
			
			<para>The last parameter of a WCI function call that is intended to return data is always
			reserved for specifying the data type to be returned (this is because most functions are 
			overloaded to return many different forms of data. By convention, this parameter is 
			usually given as a NULL cast to the relevant data type; for example:</para>

			<programlisting>
NULL::wci.browsereferencetime
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The dimensions are described in the following sections.</para>
			
		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:data_provider">
			<title>Data Provider</title>
			
			<para>The Data Provider identifies the source of the data; literally,
				<emphasis>the entity that provides the data</emphasis>. Where multiple
				sources could be identified as the source of the data, the entity that can be
				identified closest to the creation of the data item at the time of loading is
				usually used.</para>
			
			<para>A data provider can be a software process (e.g., Hirlam), a
				meteorological or climate station, an aircraft, or a person. A data provider 
				is identified by a DataProviderName. DataProviderNames are 
				used to search for the data. For convenience, Data Providers may be
				collected into groups; e.g., the DataProviderName "Hirlam" might be used
			    to search for any of the various Hirlam processes: "Hirlam 4", "Hirlam 8", 
				etc.</para>
			
			<para>When searching for data, the user may specify a single DataProviderName,
				a list of DataProviderNames (specified using an ARRAY constructor), or NULL. 
				NULL indicates that the user wants all 	data items, regardless of the data 
				source.</para>

			<para>DataProviderNames exist within a data provider namespace. A namespace can be defined by
				the WDB administrator, in order to permit the user or an application to retrieve data in
				an accustomed language or code set. The default namespace of WDB is the DataProviderNameSpaceId
				0, and is always based on English language names and international standard codes. The 
				data provider namespace being used in a querying session can be defined by the user when
				starting up the session.
			</para>
			
			<para>To retrieve all of the DataProviderNames (excluding data provider groups) that are
				currently stored in the database for the currently specified namespace, the following 
				wci.browse function call could be used:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.browse( NULL::wci.browsedataprovider );
		</programlisting>

			<para>To retrieve all of the DataProviderNames (including data provider groups) that the
				database currently has the capacity to store and display in the currently specified
				namespace, the following wci.info function call could be used:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.getDataProvider( NULL );
		</programlisting>
									
		</sect1>
		 
		<sect1 id="sec:place">
			<title>Place (Geographic Location)</title>
			
			<para>The place (geographic location) of a data item is the position of the item
				on the earth in a 2D space. In WDB, the geographic location is by default
				specified using longitude and latitude in a WGS84 coordinate system
				(though this can be changed when the database is set up; consult your system
				administrator). The geographic dimension is specified using a geometry
				object and can be either a point or a polygon.</para>
			
			<para>In addition to using geometry objects to retrieve data, the user can also
				use a PlaceName - a pre-specified name that defines a geometry object in the
				database - to specify location.</para>

			<para>As for DataProviderName, PlaceNames exist within a place namespace that can be defined
				by the WDB administrator. The default namespace of WDB is the PlaceNameSpaceId 0; defined
				in international english. As for the data provider namespace, the place namespace can be 
				defined by the user when starting up the session. 
			</para>
			
			<para>To retrieve the full list of the PlaceNames for the data values currently being stored
			in the database, use the following wci.browse function call:</para>

			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.browse( NULL::wci.browseplace );
		</programlisting>
									
			<para>At the same time as the user specifies a location to retrieve data from, it
				is also possible to specify an interpolation option for location
				calculations. These permit the user a great deal of flexibility in
				searching. Currently, interpolations such as "exact", "nearest" (retrieve the
			data value closest to the specified place), and "bilinear" (retrieve the closest data
			values and perform a bilinear interpolation of those values) are implemented.</para>
			
			<para>The form of place specification then becomes one of the two following:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
'Oslo'
		</programlisting>
			<programlisting>
'nearest Oslo'
		</programlisting>
			<programlisting>
'POINT(61 9)'
		</programlisting>
			<programlisting>
'bilinear POINT(61 9)'
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>Specifying NULL for the place definition of a query is logically
				equivalent to asking for all of the data items in the database, irrespective
				of their location.</para>
			
			<para>To retrieve all of the place names that are currently registered in the database,
				the following WCI function call can be used:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.getPlaceDefinition( NULL );
		</programlisting>

		</sect1>
		
		<sect1  id="sec:reftime">
			<title>Reference Time</title>
			
			<para>The reference time of a data item is the moment when the data item is
				referenced from. For forecast data, this would typically be the reference
				time of the data values the forecast is based upon; for observation data,
				it would typically be the time when the observation data was recorded.</para>
			
			<para>When searching for data, the user specifies the reference time (with time
				zone), or NULL. NULL indicates that the user wants all data items,
				regardless of the reference time of the data. Time is specified in WCI as
			    a text string with datetime's that are interpreted by the WCI parser.</para>

			<para>To retrieve a list of the reference times currently being stored in the
				database, use the wci.browse functionality:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.browse( NULL::wci.browsereferencetime );
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>In addition to time points, it is also possible for the user to specify time periods 
			using a variety of keywords. The keywords are: exact (default), before, after, inside, and contains. 
			And interval can be specified using two timestamps and separating them with the keyword TO, or a 
			timestamp and a duration separated by the keyword FOR. As examples, consider:
			</para>
			
			<programlisting>
exact 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>Denotes the specific time point of 11:20 UTC, on the 31st of March, 2009. The keyword 
			"exact" is actually redundant, as this is the default interpretation of a timestamp in
			WCI.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
before 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>Denotes that the user wants to return all data for the time period prior to the time 
			point of 11:20 UTC, on the 31st of March, 2009.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
after 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>Denotes that the user wants to return all data for the time period after the time 
			point of 11:20 UTC, on the 31st of March, 2009.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
inside 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00 TO 2009-05-31T11:20:00+00 
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>Denotes that the user wants to return all data inside the time period between the time 
			point of 11:20 UTC, on the 31st of March, 2009 and the same time two months later.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
inside 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00 FOR 2 months 
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>Denotes that the user wants to return all data inside the time period between the time 
			point of 11:20 UTC, on the 31st of March, 2009 and the same time two months later.</para>
			
		</sect1>
				
		<sect1 id="sec:validtime">
			<title>Valid Time</title>
			
			<para>The valid time of a data item is the time period for which the data item is
				valid. The valid time is always stored in the database as a time interval.</para>
			
			<para>When searching for data, the user specifies the valid time (with time
				zone), or NULL. NULL indicates that the user wants all data items,
				regardless of the valid time of the data. Time is specified in WCI as
			    a text string with datetime's that are interpreted by the WCI parser.</para>

			<para>As usual, the list of valid times stored in the database can be retrieved
			using the wci.browse functionality.</para>

			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.browse( NULL::wci.browsevalidtime );
		</programlisting>

			<para>Time is specified in the same way for time periods as for time points. Examples of
			how the qualifiers should be interpreted are given below:</para>

			<programlisting>
exact 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00 TO 2009-05-31T11:20:00+00 
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The exact keyword returns only time periods that match precisely with the time period specified.
			</para>
			
			<programlisting>
before 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>The before keyword returns only time periods that end before the specified time
			point. In other words, the time period from 2009-03-29 to 2009-03-30 would be returned by the query
			but the time period from 2009-03-29 to 2009-04-01 would not.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
after 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>The after keyword returns only time periods that start after the specified time point.</para>

			<programlisting>
inside 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00 TO 2009-05-31T11:20:00+00 
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>The inside keyword for time periods is true if the time period both starts and ends 
			within the designated time (the time point specified inclusive). It does not return time
			periods that merely overlap (i.e., where only the start time or the end time are within
			the given time period).</para>
			
			<programlisting>
contains 2009-03-31T11:20:00+00 TO 2009-05-31T11:20:00+00 
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The contains keyword returns all the data with valid times beginning prior to the
			specified time and ending after the specified time. Semantics are inclusive, so a valid 
			time that matches exactly would be returned as a row by this query.</para>
			
		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:value_parameter">
			<title>Value Parameter</title>
			
			<para>Each data value can be described using a "value parameter". The value
				parameter is a name that describes the physics or code table basis of the
				parameter value. The value parameter concept in WCI is broadly similar to
				the concept of meteorological parameter used in, e.g., GRIB files.</para>
						
			<para>The user searches the database for a specific parameter in the database
			using the ValueParameterName. ValueParameterNames are specified within a 
			parameter namespace. As with the other namespaces, the ParameterNameSpaceId 0
			is reserved for the default WDB namespace, and is based on international 
				english. Additional namespaces can be defined by the administrator of the
				database.
			</para>
			
			<para>To retrieve a list of the value parameters currently being stored in the
				database, use the wci.browse functionality:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.browse( NULL::wci.browsevalueparameter );
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>To list all of the value parameter names that can be stored in the database using
			the currently selected parameter namespace, the following wci.info function call could 
			be used:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.getValueParameter( NULL );
		</programlisting>

		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:level">
			<title>Level</title>
			
			<para>The <emphasis>Level</emphasis> dimension is normally used to designate the
				altitude or depth of the data value. Level is designated using a level interval (height 
				from and to) and a level parameter (e.g., height above sea level, pressure). The level
				definition can be prefixed with a level interpolation option that permits the
				user a large degree of flexibility in expressing searches. Levels are specified using
				a level specification in string form that is parsed by the WCI.</para>
			
			<para>The level designation in the WCI queries is a string. The form of the level 
			designation when querying the database is as follows:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
interpolation levelFrom TO levelTo leveparametername
		</programlisting>
		
			<para>The interpolations available are <emphasis>exact</emphasis>, 
			<emphasis>below</emphasis>, <emphasis>above</emphasis>, <emphasis>inside</emphasis>, 
			and <emphasis>any</emphasis>. The default interpolation is exact 
			(specifying the interpolation is optional). One may also omit the 
			<emphasis>TO levelTo</emphasis> construction if the level being specified is a
			point.</para>

			<para>Specifying <emphasis>any</emphasis> for the level interpolation is
				logically equivalent to specifying a NULL for the level; i.e., it retrieves
				all data items regardless of their level (height).</para>

			<para>The level parameter is specified using a LevelParameterName. LevelParameterNames
				are specified within the parameter namespace. Consequently, it is not possible
				to mix usage of ValueParameterNames and LevelParameterNames from different namespaces
				without defining a new parameter namespace. The default WDB ParameterNameSpaceId is 0
				and is based on international english. 
			</para>
			
			<para>Examples of level designations are given below:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
exact 2 height above ground distance 
		</programlisting>
			
			<programlisting>
above 0 height above mean sea level distance 
		</programlisting>
			
			<programlisting>
inside 300 TO 500 isobaric surface pressure
		</programlisting>

			<para>To retrieve a full list of the levels and level parameters currently being stored in the
				database, use the wci.browse functionality:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.browse( NULL::wci.browselevelparameter );
		</programlisting>
						
			<para>To list all of the level parameter names that can be stored in the database using
			the currently selected parameter namespace, the following wci.info function call could 
			be used:</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * FROM wci.getLevelParameter( NULL );
		</programlisting>

		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:data_version">
			<title>Data Version</title>
			
			<para>There can be several different versions of the same data value that is
				valid for the same time, position, etc. This can happen with probability
				forecast calculations or when a data value is edited (in which case the new
				value may often be inserted with a higher data version). A data version is
				always a positive whole number.</para>
			
			<para>The user may specify one or several data versions as search criteria in
				WCI, as well as NULL. NULL indicates that the user wants all versions of the
				data items specified. In addition, the user may specify the data version as
				a negative number; e.g., <emphasis>-1</emphasis>. Specifying <emphasis>-1</emphasis>
				retrieves the maximum data version in the database (i.e., the most recent version of the data item), 
				<emphasis>-2</emphasis> retrieves the second most recent, and so on.</para>
			
			<para>There is no wci.browse functionality to list all of the data versions of the data in the

		<sect1 id="sec:open_connection">
			<title>Open a connection</title>
			
			<para>To enable communication with WCI, the user must open a connection to the
				database. How this is done depends very much on the application or API that is
				being used (consult the documentation of the program or API for
				information).</para>
			
			<para>Using libpq,</para>
			
			<programlisting>
connection_ = PQconnectdb("dbname=wdb user=myuser host=localhost");
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The connection must be open and valid as long as commands are being sent and
				data retrieved from the database. It is worth noting that connections are a
				resource; the database will have limits on how many connections
				can be open at the same time. This is particularly important for massively
				multi-user applications (e.g., web applications). In such cases, the
				database connections must be managed with some care. There is also an amount 
			overhead involved with setting up a connection, so it will always be more efficient 
			to connect once and perform multiple database operations, than to connect repeatedly
			for each operation.</para>
						
		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:initialize_wci">
			<title>Initialize WCI</title>
			
			<para>Before WCI may be used by the user, it must be initialized.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT wci.begin('myuser'::name, 0::integer, 0::integer, 0::integer);
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The username is used to identify the user with WCI (this is used in setting
				up internal WCI variables). The three following numbers are the namespace
				codes for data provider namespace, place name space, and parameter name space.
				The wci.begin can also be called without setting these three variables, in 
				which case they are set to the default (usually 0, 0, 0) by the system.</para>
			
			<para>The username of the wci user can be a different identity than the one the
				user connected with (always assuming, of course, that your user has
				appropriate rights). This allows, for instance, for a single system to act
				as a multiplexing front-end to retrieve data available from several
				distinct users.</para>

			<para>Name spaces are used to identify what set of names should be used for searching 
				the database. While the user is in a namespace, only the data defined in that
				namespace is visible to the user. If the user should wish, for some reason, to
				combine data from different namespaces within an application, it will be necessary
				to call wci.begin repeatedly; once for each time the application needs to change its
				namespace.
				</para>
						
		</sect1>
		
		<sect1 id="sec:reading_wci">
			<title>Read from the WCI</title>
			
			<para>As soon as the user has initialized WCI using wci.begin, the database is
				ready for retrieval of data. Data is retrieved using the wci.read function,
				and data is searched for by setting the appropriate dimensions in that
				call.</para>
			
		<sect2 id="sec:reading_wci_point">
			<title>Reading Point Data from WCI</title>

			<para>The wci.read function is overloaded to permit the user to read either point data or binary data (entire grids)
				from the database. The last parameter in the wci.read function allows the user to specify the return type of 
				the query. To return point data values, the user specifies wci.returnFloat.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * 
FROM wci.read ( ARRAY['hirlam norway'], -- Data provider name
				'POLYGON((10 60,11 60,11 61,10 61,10 60))',  -- Location
				'inside 1980-01-01 12:00:00Z TO 1980-01-01 18:00:00Z', -- Reference time 
				NULL, -- Valid Time 
				ARRAY['air temperature'],  -- Value Parameter
				'2 height above ground distance',  -- Level
				ARRAY[-1], -- Data version
				NULL::wci.returnfloat -- Return type
			  )
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The above query returns Hirlam data for a specific region (given by the place
				geometry), whose referencetime is on or between 12:00 to 18:00 on January
				1, 1980; the query will return data for any valid times, for any air temperature.
				It will return data at 2 metre above ground, but only the latest version of such data.
				Values will be returned as point data.</para>
			
			<para>The data provider, place definition, value parameter and level parameter must all
			be defined within the namespaces given in the wci.begin call that preceded the wci.read
			call. In this particular case, the place definition is a geometry definition, but it would
			also have been possible to use a placename. Consider, for example, the following query:</para>

			<programlisting>
SELECT * 
FROM wci.read ( ARRAY['hirlam norway'], -- Data provider name
				'oslo',  -- Location
				'1980-01-01 12:00:00Z', -- Reference time 
				'inside 1980-01-02 12:00:00 TO 1980-01-12 12:00:00', -- Valid Time 
				ARRAY['%precipitation%'],  -- Value Parameter
				NULL,  -- Level
				NULL, -- Data version
				NULL::wci.returnfloat -- Return type
			  )
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The above call returns all precipitation parameters valid for the 10 days following the 
				given referencetime measured at the nearest point to oslo. Oslo, in this case, is a place name
				usually defined as a geographical point within the database. Prefixing the place name is the 
	µ			interpolation that we wish to use when retrieving points; we could also have used any of the
				alternatives defined in the reference manual below. Note the use of SQL wildcard characters in the
				value parameter; although these slow down queries (since wildcard searching is not as efficient
				as a straight comparison), it is possible to use the wci.read call in this way. Note also that names 
				can be written in upper or lower case; the wci.read function call is not case-sensitive.</para>

			<title>Reading Grid Data from WCI</title>

			<para>Reading grid data from the database is a two-step process. First the user retrieves the Grid ID with 
				wci.read function (with wci.returnGId), and then the grid itself can be retrieved using the wci.fetch function call.</para>
			
			<programlisting>
SELECT * 
FROM wci.read ( ARRAY['hirlam norway'],    -- Data provider name
				'hirlam 10km grid',          -- Location description
				'1980-01-01 12:00:00Z',    -- Reference time 
				NULL,                      -- Valid Time (returns all forecasts) 
				ARRAY['air temperature'],  -- Value Parameter
				'2 height above ground distance',  -- Level
				ARRAY[-1],                 -- Data version
				NULL::wci.returngid        -- Return type
			  )
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The above query returns the list of grids available for Hirlam data, defined
				on the hirlam 10km grid (i.e., if there were data on 20km or 4km grids, these would
				not be returned), whose referencetime is 12:00 on January 1, 1980. The query will return
				all grid references to air temperature forecasts for the above configuration.</para>
			
			<para>Grid IDs are essentially 8-bit integers, that are then passed to the wci.fetch
				command, as given below:</para>

			<programlisting>
SELECT * 
FROM wci.fetch ( 7411403,          -- Grid ID (bigint)
				 NULL::wci.grid    -- Return Type
				)
		</programlisting>
			
			<para>The above call returns a single row, containing a binary string containing the actual grid data.
				It also includes additional information detailing the configuration of the grid. For details about
			the wci.fetch call, see the function reference.</para>
